// null and undefined ------------------------------------

// null - explicitly set a variable with no value; e.g usecase: when we want to clear a form and don't want to store anything at that point to a variable.
// undefined - for variables that have not yet been defined.

//let age;
//console.log(age, age + 3, `the age is ${age}`); // undefined NaN "the age is undefined"

let age = null;
console.log(age, age + 3, `the age is ${age}`); // null 3 "the age is null"
